        upstream to spawn. As many as 20 can be seen in one spot, where they
        often catch salmon leaping out of the water with their paws.

          Dogs are as smart as a two-year-old child. According to canine
          researcher and author Stanley Coren, your toddler and pup are about on
          par when it comes to brains. He also explained that man's best friend
          can count, understand more than 150 words, and even trick people or
          other dogs to get treats. Intelligence also varies based on breed—Border
          collies are the smartest dog breed.</h3>

          it means it's happy to see you, right? Not necessarily. According to
          Discovery.com, dogs wag their tails to the right when they're happy and
          to the left when they're frightened. Wagging low means they're insecure,
          and rapid tail wagging accompanied by tense muscles or dilated pupils
          can signal aggression.</h3>

          pre-domestication days thousands of years ago. The behavior is more

          acting jealous when you give other dogs attention,” says Nikki Naser,
          Resident Pet Expert at Chewy. “It might not be exactly how we experience
          jealousy, but research has shown that it's similar to how an infant
          might get jealous.” That certainly tracks with dogs' intelligence being
          on par with that of a toddler. This dog jealousy is something dog
          groomers experience when they come home to their own dogs—and it's one
          of the things pet groomers wish you knew</h3>

            The term “puss” is the root of the principal word for “cat” in the
            Romanian term pisica and the root of secondary words in Lithuanian (puz)
            and Low German puus. Some scholars suggest that “puss” could be
            imitative of the hissing sound used to get a cat's attention. As a slang
            word for the female pudenda, it could be associated with the connotation
            of a cat being soft, warm, and fuzzy</h3>
