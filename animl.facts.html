    <h1>Animal Facts!</h1>

    <h2>Bears</h2>
    <p>
      Every year grizzlies gather to fish for the salmon that are swimming
      upstream to spawn. As many as 20 can be seen in one spot, where they often
      catch salmon leaping out of the water with their paws.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grizzlies claws are as long as human fingers. They are up to 4 inches
      long.
    </p>

    <p>
      They can run at 30 miles (56kmp) an hour. Despite their large size, they
      can move fast. The large hump on their shoulders powers their fast-moving
      front legs. This is why they tell you if you bump into a grizzly, don't
      try and run from it!
    </p>

    <p>
      They give birth while hibernating. Female grizzly bears give birth while
      hibernating. The grizzly cubs will stay in the den drinking milk until the
      end of winter.
    </p>

    <p>
      They have a distinctive hump on their back. This hump is actually a large
      muscle which controls their forearms.
    </p>

    <h1>Dogs</h1>

    <p>
      Dogs are as smart as a two-year-old child. According to canine researcher
      and author Stanley Coren, your toddler and pup are about on par when it
      comes to brains. He also explained that man's best friend can count,
      understand more than 150 words, and even trick people or other dogs to get
      treats. Intelligence also varies based on breed—Border collies are the
      smartest dog breed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tail wagging has its own language If your dog excitedly wags its tail, it
      means it's happy to see you, right? Not necessarily. According to
      Discovery.com, dogs wag their tails to the right when they're happy and to
      the left when they're frightened. Wagging low means they're insecure, and
      rapid tail wagging accompanied by tense muscles or dilated pupils can
      signal aggression.
    </p>

    <p>
      Puppies are born blind and deaf Newborn dogs are still developing,
      according to Psychology Today, so their ear canals and eyes are still
      closed. Most puppies open their eyes and respond to noises after about two
      weeks.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's not abnormal for dogs to eat feces It's no secret: Dogs often eat
      their own feces (and other fecal matter too). But though it might be
      gross, the ASPCA says it's perfectly normal, stemming from their
      pre-domestication days thousands of years ago. The behavior is more common
      in puppies, while older dogs usually grow out of it, although some still
      do it into adulthood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dogs get jealous “You're not imagining it if you think your dog is acting
      jealous when you give other dogs attention,” says Nikki Naser, Resident
      Pet Expert at Chewy. “It might not be exactly how we experience jealousy,
      but research has shown that it's similar to how an infant might get
      jealous.” That certainly tracks with dogs' intelligence being on par with
      that of a toddler. This dog jealousy is something dog groomers experience
      when they come home to their own dogs—and it's one of the things pet
      groomers wish you knew.

    <h1>Cats</h1>

    <p>
      The term “puss” is the root of the principal word for “cat” in the
      Romanian term pisica and the root of secondary words in Lithuanian (puz)
      and Low German puus. Some scholars suggest that “puss” could be imitative
      of the hissing sound used to get a cat's attention. As a slang word for
      the female pudenda, it could be associated with the connotation of a cat
      being soft, warm, and fuzzy
    </p>

    <p>
      While it is commonly thought that the ancient Egyptians were the first to
      domesticate cats, the oldest known pet cat was recently found in a
      9,500-year-old grave on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. This grave
      predates early Egyptian art depicting cats by 4,000 years or more.
    </p>

    <p>
      The group of words associated with cat (catt, cath, chat, katze) stem from
      the Latin catus, meaning domestic cat, as opposed to feles, or wild cat.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first cat in space was a French cat named Felicette (a.k.a.
      “Astrocat”) In 1963, France blasted the cat into outer space. Electrodes
      implanted in her brains sent neurological signals back to Earth. She
      survived the trip.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the Middle Ages, cats were associated with withcraft, and on St.
      John's Day, people all over Europe would stuff them into sacks and toss
      the cats into bonfires. On holy days, people celebrated by tossing cats
      from church towers

    <h1>Snakes</h1>

    <p>
      If a person suddenly turned into a snake, they would be about 4 times
      longer than they are now and only a few inches thick. While humans have 24
      ribs, some snakes can have more than 400.[
    </p>

    <p>
      The most advanced snake species in the world is believed to be the black
      mamba. It has the most highly evolved venom delivery system of any snake
      on Earth. It can strike up to 12 times in a row, though just one bite is
      enough to kill a grown man.
    </p>

    <p>
      The inland taipan is the world's most toxic snake, meaning it has both the
      most toxic venom and it injects the most venom when it bites. Its venom
      sacs hold enough poison to kill up to 80 people.
    </p>

    <p>
      The death adder has the fastest strike of any snake in the world. It can
      attack, inject venom, and go back to striking position in under 0.15
      seconds.[3] While snakes do not have external ears or eardrums, their
      skin, muscles, and bones carry sound vibrations to their inner ears.
    </p>

    <p>
      The inland taipan is the world's most toxic snake, meaning it has both the
      most toxic venom and it injects the most venom when it bites. Its venom
      sacs hold enough poison to kill up to 80 people.
    </p>

    <h1>Spiders</h1>

    <p>
      Spiders have blue blood. In humans, oxygen is bound to hemoglobin, a
      molecule that contains iron and gives blood its red color. In spiders,
      oxygen is bound to hemocyanin, a molecule that contains copper rather than
      iron.
    </p>

    <p>The Bagheera kiplingi is the world's only (mostly) vegetarian spider.</p>

    <p>
      Abandoned spider webs are called “cobwebs.” The word “cob” is an obsolete
      word meaning “spider” and is a shortened form of the Old English word
      attercop, which literally means “poison head.” Etymologists see a
      connection between cob for spider and cob for corn in that a cob of corn
      means the “head” or “top” of the corn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spider-Man is one of the most popular superheroes. In early comic books,
      the radioactive spider that bites Peter Parker is incorrectly referred to
      as an insect.
    </p>

    <p>
      In rare instances, some spider bites can cause blood disorders. For
      example, the brown recluse venom may cause red blood cells to burst. This
      can lead to other symptoms, such as acute kidney injury and jaundice.
